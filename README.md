## Purpose

The purpose of the Frames project is to enumerate and analyze various ways of interpreting reality.

It provides a structured listing of different interpretations (Frames) that people consciously or subconsciously adopt during their daily lives.

The goal is to help people figure out which one's they're using, and help them choose better ones if necessary.

## Content

The content will be stored in the Frames directory, one file per frame.

## How to Contribute

The best way to contribute today is to submit a PR to add a new Frame file under the Frames directory.
